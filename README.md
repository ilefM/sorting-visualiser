# sorting-visualiser

This project is a simple sorting algorithms visualiser

## Features

- [x] Generate a number of collumns (or bars) with all a random heigh.
- [x] Reset all the configuration.
- [ ] Choose a sorting algorithm from an input list of algorithms.
- [ ] Start the execution of an algorithm.
- [ ] Pause the execution at any time (the bars state are paused).
- [ ] Print the execution time of the algorithm.

## My journal process

- I began by generating statically some collumn with random heighs with javascript to learn how it works.
- Once I'm getting used to the DOM API I added some input with button that so then the user can generate the bars dynamically.
