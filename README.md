# sorting-visualiser

This project is a simple sorting algorithms visualiser made with html, css and vanilla javascript

We can visualise the execution of a sort algorithm

## Features

- [x] Generate a number of collumns (or bars) with all a random heigh.
- [x] Reset all the configuration.
- [ ] Choose a sorting algorithm from an input list of algorithms.
      (At this moment, only the bubble sort is available)
- [x] Start the execution of an algorithm.
- [ ] Pause the execution at any time (the bars state are paused).
- [ ] Print the execution time of the algorithm.

## Improvements
- [ ] Replace some units by vh units (ex : title) for more responsiveness
- [ ] Use the function `window.requestAnimationFrame()`
