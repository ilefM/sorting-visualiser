<h1>sorting-visualiser</h1>

<p>This project is a simple sorting algorithms visualiser</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
- [ ] Generate a number of collumns (or bars) with all a random heigh.
- [ ] Reset all the configuration.
- [ ] Choose a sorting algorithm from an input list of algorithms.
- [ ] Start the execution of an algorithm.
- [ ] Pause the execution at any time (the bars state are paused).
- [ ] Print the execution time of the algorithm.

<h2>My journal process for this project</h2>
- I began by generating statically some collumn with random heighs with javascript to learn how it works. 
- Once I'm getting used to the DOM API I added some input with button that so then the user can generate the bars dynamically.
